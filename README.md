# Delphi7_Keygen
Delphi7 Enterprise Keygen Algorithm
I used IDA to parse the algorithm from keygen.exe(sha256:02572d113818e977e2f581c1a3501987fe63b784364ccab4c27bfee2c0f68523)  
and I converted all parts of the keygen into python(include LCG rng in delphi)  
so the result given by the keygen is completely equals to my python version.

Here's some result:
